# 🥗 Food PG App

A clean and modern Android application built to help PG/Hostel residents view their weekly menu, scan to take meals, and keep track of their daily food consumption.  
The app allows users to scan a QR code to collect their meal up to **three times a day** (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner), and it maintains a **history of which day and what time** the user has taken their food.  
Along with meal tracking, the app provides a beautiful UI with smooth navigation, daily menu highlights, dish cards, and category filters for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.
